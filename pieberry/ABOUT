Pieberry has principles:

0) Storage is cheap and plentiful

Hard disks cost bugger all and Pieberry is cavalier with file
space. Much better to have several copies of the same document in
different places than to not be able to find it when you want
it. Pieberry will try to keep an eye on multiple documents and stop
things getting out of hand.

1) Near enough is well and truly good enough

Pieberry is designed to be robust to the vagaries of ordinary internet
and corporate life. Poorly made websites, inadequate metadata, foolish
file naming conventions will not faze it, it will always make a best
guess and keep on going.

2) Nobody (but you) knows or cares about Pieberry

Pieberry is not an enterprise-wide solution, it isn't "social", and it
doesn't want to get you into trouble for using 'non standard'
software. It is portable and requires no installation on Windows. It
doesn't shove everything into some database schema or sync things to
the cloud. You may have a powerful data and document tracking system
available to you, managing your stuff, but as far as anyone else can
see, peering into your part of the share drive, is an immaculately
logical, well named, navigable file structure that they can find
whatever it is that they were looking for and sod off again.

3) Pieberry does not spazz out

Change your filenames, delete stuff, move stuff around. Pieberry won't
freak. At worst, it may lose track of a file and think it's a new
one. Otherwise, Pieberry just does its best to keep up with what
you're doing and keep things navigable.
