Plan for fundamental object

* pieObject Plan

** Methods of interest

*** MakeBibData(type=unic, key=unic)
    - Crunches available data and sets bibliography data
    - Will need to utilise PybTex for author field at least
    - Set fundamental fields as priority

*** SetFileLocation(loc)
    - Needs to set a variety of fields appropriately when file is moved
    - Keep in mind movement to/from staging areas

** Property fields
