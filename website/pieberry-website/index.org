* Announcing Pieberry

This is the first website of the revamped Pieberry library assistant
software. It is still in Beta at this stage, but should be in a good
state for you to give it a go. See [[download.html][the downloads]] section for options
for your platform.

* It's a coping strategy

Pieberry is an idiosyncratic blend of functionality that you would
typically find in applications classed as:

- File managers
- Desktop search engines
- Bibliography managers
- Bookshelf managers
- "Screen scraping" scripts
- Web search clients.

While this makes it a creature that is "neither fish nor fowl", it has
a compelling set of functionality for a particular, very common user:
the neglected and forlorn desk worker, struggling to cope with
gigabytes of files and data, with only the basic tools of typical
corporate IT at their disposal - an email client, Windows Explorer,
and a web browser. 

*Pieberry is a coping strategy*, above all. It is a way of coping with
 otherwise inadequate work tools. It doesn't strive to be the program
 that you would implement if you had total control over your
 environment and you could implement a system to optimise your
 workflow. It caters to the reality that most office workers face - a
 distant and fundamentally uninterested IT and Records management
 bureaucracy, and strict policies and privilege restrictions for
 users. It makes the most of these conditions by improving management
 of documents of all kinds, making them findable and referable in a
 professional context.

* Philosophy & approach

The approach taken by this program is somewhat at odds with common
wisdom about how software, particularly workplace software should
work. Perhaps it can be best summed up by 

** Storage is cheap and plentiful

Hard disks cost bugger all and Pieberry is cavalier with file
space. Much better to have several copies of the same document in
different places than to not be able to find it when you want
it. Pieberry will try to keep an eye on multiple documents and stop
things getting out of hand.

** Near enough is well and truly good enough

Pieberry is designed to be robust to the vagaries of ordinary internet
and corporate life. Poorly made websites, inadequate metadata, foolish
file naming conventions will not faze it, it will always make a best
guess and keep on going.

** Nobody (but you) knows or cares about Pieberry

Pieberry is not an enterprise-wide solution, it isn't "social", and it
doesn't want to get you into trouble for using 'non standard'
software. It is portable and requires no installation on Windows. It
doesn't shove everything into some database schema or sync things to
the cloud. You may have a powerful data and document tracking system
available to you, managing your stuff, but as far as anyone else can
see, peering into your part of the share drive, is an immaculately
logical, well named, navigable file structure that they can find
whatever it is that they were looking for and sod off again.

** Pieberry does not freak out

Feel free to change your filenames, delete stuff, move stuff
around. Pieberry won't panic. At worst, it may lose track of a file
and think it's a new one. Otherwise, Pieberry just does its best to
keep up with what you're doing and keep things navigable.
